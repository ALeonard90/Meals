<h2>Welcome and Happy Holidays, Neighbors.</h2>
<div class="nourished">
<p>With my first WDI project falling right before Christmas break I thought it would be great to do something for our community. With this on my mind, I came up with "Nourishing Neighbors," a website that allows people to commit to making a meal, donating canned goods, or writing a Holiday greeting with the promise that I will pickup and deliver what ever one prepares during my two week break from class.</p>

<p>What you provide will not only nourish your brother's or sister's body, but will nourish both of your souls.</p>

<p>If you feel compelled to, please sign up. Additionally, I'd love for you to check out my code on <a href="https://github.com/ALeonard90/Meals">GitHub.</a> Your constructive criticism will be of much help! </p>
